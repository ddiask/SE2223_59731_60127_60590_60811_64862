Metrics Review:
 - You should add a few examples of classes and their scores in those metrics. 
 - While the the ExporterToCSV class contains the message chain code smell, it only has a CBO score of 9.0, 
   which is a low value comparared to other classes in the project, so it might not be the best example.
