Review:
  -> I agree with my coleague, every action that can be made for task is well represented and explained properly, with every pre codition and post condition.

Metrics Review:
 - You should add a few examples of classes and their scores in those metrics. 
 - While the the ExporterToCSV class contains the message chain code smell, it only has a CBO score of 9.0, 
   which is a low value comparared to other classes in the project, so it might not be the best example.
