Email Use case Review

-->The diagram has an orthographic error;
-->In pre-condition to export as email, you should refer that you need a password provided by Google and the system needs to have resources with emails.
--> In my opinion, you should specify how "Select Exporter" and "Insert the email properties" work. I understand that you do that in the export email, but you should separate the descriptions.

- The use cases and actors look correct to me.
- The first phrase in the description sounds confusing, 
  you used the words select and export, or variations, too many times.

Project Use Case

--> I think you should specify in Use Case Diagram that System refers to Operating System where GanttProject is running.
--> You should merge the use cases "Save Project" and "Save Current Project" in one use case.
--> You have some orthographic errors in your descriptions;
-->I think you should refer to the pre-condition of "Import System" that you need to have a GanttProject saved on your computer.
--> Edit project uses other features of GanttProject that are not specified in this use case. So you should add a GanttProject System to ensure these features.

Line_of_Code metrics Review

--> There is indeed a no comment in CalendarActivityImpl where we can see the code smell and from the datagram we can conclude there is a lot of non commented features.
--> The average lines of code per method which is about 9 tells us that there is a lot of not complicated methods, however like my coleague mentioned there is some
methods that are extremely big with about 100 lines of code which makes the code really hard to follow.

Enail Use case Review

--> The email functionality is well represented and with suficient explaning to understand what each method implements.

Email Use case Review

I concur with the use case made by my colleague.
The pre condition "Insert the e-mail properties" use case and the "Export as e-mail" use case are a bit confusing for some users withou privious knowledge.
The desriptions are fine and the actors are correct
