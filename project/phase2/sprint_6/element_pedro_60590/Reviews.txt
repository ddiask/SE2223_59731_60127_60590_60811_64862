Task Hierarchy Use Case

I agree with the diagram and description made by my colleague.
He could however, make it more clear that the GanttSystem actor
does not participate in operations like "Show Column", "Hide Column",
"Resize Column", "Move Column", "Sort Column Entries" because they do not edit
the task properties in itselt.
